## 🚀 Deployment Status

**GitHub Actions is now deploying your app!**

### Check Deployment Progress:

1. **Go to GitHub Actions:**
   ```
   https://github.com/srdjankrco/medical-clinic-demo/actions
   ```

2. **Look for the workflow run:**
   - Name: "Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD"
   - Branch: `development`
   - Latest commit: "ci: Enable deployment from development branch"

3. **Deployment takes ~3-4 minutes**
   - Building application (~1 min)
   - Deploying to Azure (~2-3 min)

---

## 🧪 After Deployment

Once the GitHub Actions workflow completes (shows green ✓):

### 1. **Open Your Azure Static Web App**
   ```
   https://purple-meadow-0bc882803.1.azurestaticapps.net
   ```
   *(Check Azure Portal for exact URL)*

### 2. **Verify the Fix**
   - ✅ App loads without errors
   - ✅ No MIME type errors in console (F12)
   - ✅ All pages navigate correctly
   - ✅ Direct URLs work (try `/patients`)
   - ✅ Refresh works on any page (F5)

### 3. **Check Network Tab (F12 → Network)**
   - Find any `.js` file in `/assets/`
   - Click on it → Headers
   - Verify: `Content-Type: application/javascript` ✅

---

## 📊 What Was Fixed

### The MIME Type Error
```
❌ Before: Failed to load module script - MIME type error
✅ After: All JavaScript modules load correctly
```

### Configuration Changes

**staticwebapp.config.json:**
```json
{
  "navigationFallback": {
    "exclude": ["/assets/*", "/*.js", ...]  // ✅ Excludes JS files
  },
  "mimeTypes": {
    ".js": "application/javascript",   // ✅ Correct MIME type
    ".mjs": "application/javascript"   // ✅ ES modules support
  }
}
```

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - development  # ✅ Now watches development branch
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs:**
   - Click on the failed workflow
   - Look for error messages
   - Common issues: missing secrets, build errors

2. **Verify secrets are configured:**
   - Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Should have: `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN`

3. **Check Azure Portal:**
   - Go to your Static Web App resource
   - Look at Deployment History
   - Check for errors

### If app still shows errors after deployment:

1. **Clear browser cache:** Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl + F5
3. **Wait a few minutes** - DNS/CDN propagation

## 📋 Branch Strategy

You're now working with:

- **`development` branch** - Your active development branch (✅ deployed)
- **`main` branch** - Behind remote, needs sync (⚠️ has conflicts)

### To sync main later (optional):

```powershell
# Option 1: Merge development into main
git checkout main
git merge development
git push origin main

# Option 2: Reset main to match development
git checkout main
git reset --hard development
git push origin main --force
```
